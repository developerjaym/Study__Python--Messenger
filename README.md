# Study__Python--Messenger
Just trying to learn python and flask
[Here's the front-end](https://github.com/developerjaym/Study__React--Messenger)

## The Basic Idea
It's supposed to look like a clone of Android.
- You can chat with friends
- You can install apps
- You can play some games

## Why?
As mentioned above, this was just a project to help me learn Flask and SQLAlchemy.
